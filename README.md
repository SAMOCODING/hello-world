# hello-world
First repository on GitHub as I wish to learn to use Git, assorted programming, houdini fx, nuke and more.

- 👋 Hi, I’m @SAMOCODING
- 👀 I’m interested in expanding my possibiities.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to utilize GitHub. This aspect will help me learn to develop stronger programming foundations through a series of certifications. In turn, I am hoping this will add strength and skillset to apply within nuke, houdini, and unreal engine 5.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate in the future, but for now, I will focus on learning how I can collaborate as I progress. 
- 📫 How to reach me will be better defined in the future also.
